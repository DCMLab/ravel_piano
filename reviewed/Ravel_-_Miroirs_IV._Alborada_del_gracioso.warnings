============================================================

DCML_NON_CHORD_TONES_ABOVE_THRESHOLD_WARNING (19, 39, '3/4', 'V') ms3.Parse.ravel_piano.Ravel_-_Miroirs_IV_Alborada_del_gracioso --
	The label 'V' in m. 39, onset 3/4 (MC 39, onset 3/4) seems not to correspond well to the score (which does not necessarily mean it is wrong).
	In the context of D.bI, it expresses the scale degrees ('5', '7', '2') [('Ab', 'C', 'Eb')].
	The corresponding score segment has 1 within-label and 4 out-of-label note onsets, a ratio of 0.8 > 0.6 (the current, arbitrary, threshold).
	If it turns out the label is correct, please add the header of this warning to the IGNORED_WARNINGS, ideally followed by a free-text comment in subsequent lines starting with a space or tab.
