	None of the MCs following the irregular MC 17 complete it.

INCOMPLETE_MC_WRONGLY_COMPLETED_WARNING (3, 18) ms3.Parse.ravel_piano.Ravel_-_Miroirs_II_Oiseaux_tristes
	None of the MCs following the irregular MC 18 complete it.

    The above result from using compound and simple meters interchangeably without announcement, and these two warnings refer in fact to the same bar: mc 17 (mn 15) duration 9/16 is functioning as 2/4, and the 2/4 mc 18 completes mn 15.

	None of the MCs following the irregular MC 49 complete it.

    The additional beats in MCs 46 and 49, which leave them unable to complete MCs 45 and 48 respectively, result from the first portion of the bar being a cadenza-like flourish outside of the meter.
